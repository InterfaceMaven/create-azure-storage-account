# Azure tables

Explored Azure Tables that provide a key/value store for applications that need to store data values, but do not need the full functionality and structure of a relational database.

## What I learned:
Created a table named products
added entities; PartitionKey groups related entities to distribute load; RowKey uniquely identifies within the partition. Together they form a fast composite primary key for lookups. Also manually entered data into the table using the storage browser interface.
