# Azure Files

Explored Azure Files and create a cloud-based file share.

## What I learned:

When connecting to the file share I learnt that there are generated scripts show exactly how to mount the share using platform-native commands, illustrating hybrid access patterns from virtual machines, containers, or on-prem servers.
