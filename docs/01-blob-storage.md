# Blob Storage

Documentation in progress...

## What I learned:
- (Will update as I work through the lab)


**Commit:** "Create docs folder for detailed notes"

Click **"Commit new file"**


## ✅ After this, your repo structure will look like:
```
create-azure-storage-account/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── data/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── docs/
│   └── 01-blob-storage.md
└── screenshots/
    └── .gitkeep
