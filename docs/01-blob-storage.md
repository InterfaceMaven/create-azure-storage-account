# Blob Storage
Created blob container "data" with Private access 
Created virtual directory "products" 
Uploaded product1.json to the product_data folder 


## What I learned:
created a virtual folder called product_data
The folder only exists because it has a blob (product1.json) in it
If you delete the file, the folder disappears (it's not a "real" directory)
This is flat namespace behavior - folders are just prefixes in the blob name
