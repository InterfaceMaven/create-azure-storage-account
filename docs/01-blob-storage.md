# Blob Storage

Documentation in progress...

## What I learned:
- (Will update as I work through the lab)

## Screenshots:
- (To be added)
```

**Commit:** "Create docs folder for detailed notes"

Click **"Commit new file"**

---

### 3. Create the `screenshots/` folder

Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**

**File path:** `screenshots/.gitkeep`

**Content:** Leave empty or add: `# Screenshots will be added here`

**Commit:** "Create screenshots folder"

Click **"Commit new file"**

---

### 4. Create placeholders for the other doc files (optional - or do as you go)

You can create these now or as you complete each section:
- `docs/02-data-lake-gen2.md`
- `docs/03-azure-files.md`
- `docs/04-azure-tables.md`

Same format as `01-blob-storage.md`

---

## ✅ After this, your repo structure will look like:
```
create-azure-storage-account/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── data/
│   └── .gitkeep
├── docs/
│   └── 01-blob-storage.md
└── screenshots/
    └── .gitkeep
